My M.A. Thesis is titled 'Quantifying Variation in American School Safety with Explainable Machine Learning: An Application of Machine Learning Feature Importances for the Social Sciences'. On this repository, I share the code that I have used to generate the results in my thesis. This includes Python and R code, as well as some LaTeX code that was used to generate regression and summary statistics. The results from the Python and R scripts have been knit into HTML files, for your ease of viewing. Please do reach out if there is any way that I can help!

Abstract: 

Social scientists, methodologists and policy analysts often work with datasets that contain numerous potential explanatory variables, which contain a mix of data types (e.g., survey items measured on different scales). This presents unique challenges for considering these variables within the same model. An approach utilizing machine learning feature importances, a key metric of Explainable Machine Learning, is illustrated through an investigation of variation in American school safety along markers of student disadvantage (e.g., students with low grades, or students who do not regard academic achievement as important). This study is based on the 2017â€“2018 School Survey of Crime and Safety (SSOCS) conducted by the United States Department of Education, which captures perceptions and responses from school leaders, on the safety conditions of their respective schools. After an illustrative example illustrating the limitations and value of a conventional linear regression approach, random forest regressors are fit and tuned on a theoretically-relevant subset of features in this dataset, before SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values were calculated as feature importance metrics for each feature and observation in the data. Results indicate that schools with a higher percentage of disadvantaged students and/or schools that implemented random sweeps were, on average, less safe. On the other hand, schools that implemented parental involvement strategies were, on average, more safe. The value of this explainable machine learning approach for the school safety literature, policy analysis and wider social and behavioural research is also discussed, along with limitations and future directions on how SHAP values could be employed for social science research.
